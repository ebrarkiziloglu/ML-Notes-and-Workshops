# Machine Learning Workshops

I attend a winter camp on Fundamentals of Machine Learning organized by @bogaziciai. I collect my notes and workshops code in this directory.

Here are the topics I cover here:
* Linear Regression
* Polynomial Regression
* Gradient Descent
* Logistic Regression
* kNN
* kMeans
* Decision Trees
* Boosting Algorithms
* Neural Networks
